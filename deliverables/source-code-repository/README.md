## AI Feedback
Hello there! Thanks for submitting your 'Source Code Repository' deliverable. As your AI mentor, I'm here to provide detailed and constructive feedback to help you elevate your project. It's great to see your project, 'AI Powered Fashion Recommendation System,' progressing, and I'm looking forward to seeing how your code develops.

Let's dive into this specific submission. The deliverable you've provided is a PDF document titled 'SmartBridge_RFS shortfalls clarification_05_02_2026_27.pdf'. Unfortunately, this does not align with the expected outcome for a 'Source Code Repository.' The expectation for this deliverable is the actual source code – typically a link to a Git repository (like GitHub or GitLab) containing all your project's code, organized into directories, with appropriate README files, and potentially initial commits showing your project's setup. A PDF document, while it might contain explanations or design choices, cannot stand in for the code itself.

Regarding completeness, the current submission is entirely missing the core component: the source code. This means we can't assess any aspects of 'Technical Implementation and Code Quality,' 'Algorithm Performance and Accuracy,' or 'System Design and Architecture' based on this deliverable, which are all significant portions of your project's evaluation criteria (30%, 25%, and 20% respectively). While the PDF might contain valuable information, it doesn't demonstrate the actual implementation. To meet the project objectives, particularly 'To design and implement a machine learning pipeline...' and 'To develop and integrate various recommendation algorithms...', the source code is the primary evidence.

For concrete, actionable improvements, your immediate next step is to set up a version control repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). Once you have created this repository, push your initial project structure, any setup scripts, early data exploration code, or even just a `README.md` file outlining your planned directory structure and technologies. Then, please submit the *link* to this repository as your 'Source Code Repository' deliverable. For example, your submission should look like `https://github.com/yourusername/your-fashion-recommendation-system.git`. This will allow me to review your code organization, initial setup, and adherence to best practices as you begin to write your code.

To better align with your project objectives and evaluation criteria, ensure your repository starts reflecting progress towards objective 1 ('To design and implement a machine learning pipeline...') as soon as possible. Even at 11% progress, I would expect to see empty directories for `data/`, `src/`, `models/`, `notebooks/`, and a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` file. This early structure demonstrates planning and adherence to good development practices, which contribute to 'System Design and Architecture' and 'Technical Implementation and Code Quality.' Remember, version control is not just for storing code, but also for tracking changes, collaborating, and demonstrating your development process effectively. I'm here to help if you encounter any difficulties setting this up. Keep up the good work on the conceptualization, and let's get that code repository established!
